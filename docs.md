# Documentation

This serves as perhaps a good place to document what the fuck is going on....

### Dynamic Pages

Aim: Function like CTFd add page feature
Usage: Just add your page as per usual

### Dynamic Menu Item

1) you can use it to link to your dynamic Page
things to note:
URL is just the url of it. tip: `/<whatever u want>`
priority is such that the higher numbers means higher priority

PermaLink: can ignore ngl

### Email validation is self explanatory i hope :D
